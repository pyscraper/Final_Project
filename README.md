# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
(be sure to read the instructions given in course Moodle)

Based on the wide open three-point percentage (NBA.com), stamina (2K18), shooting stability (Standard Deviation of 3pt%) ,the chosen location of money balls and strategy of each player, we simulate the score of all the participants in each round and pick players with the top two scores (player numbers may bigger than 2 if three or more get the top two scores simultaneously) to the final round. And then, we simulates the winner. After thousands of simulations, the program concludes the winning rate for each player and print out the best strategy and chosen location of money balls for each player.


## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

The variable "shoot" is a pseudo-random int number generated from 1 to 100, in this scenario, if the field goal percentage is larger than "shoot", this shoot would score; The variable "runtime" is a pseudo-random number generated from 2 to 4, it represents the time a player needs to run from one spot to the next spot; The variable "shootingtime" is a pseudo-random number which could be generated by different strategies, it represents the shooting time of one shot of one player; The variable "prob" is a pseudo-random int number generated from 1 to 100,
if the one-fire probability is larger than "prob", the player would reach to a on-fire state.

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
The winning rate of each player may highly depend on his wide open 3 point-field goal and influenced by his performance stability, which is up to the variance of each player's 3 point-field goal. And most of players may choose strategy 3 to get as higher points at money ball location as possible.

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)


## Instructions on how to use the program:
